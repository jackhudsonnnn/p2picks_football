In the table list page, there should be a dedicated table named "The Bet Zone", always listed as the first option.
- Should be a slightly darker tint than other listed table.
- Should have some sort of checklist for tables it would like to subscribe to. For example, if a user is a part of table_1, table_2, and table_3, they may opt to only get bet proposals from table_1 and table_3.
