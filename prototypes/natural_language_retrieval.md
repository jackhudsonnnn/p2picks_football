Retrieval from a vector database for users to find a mode of their choosing. Users can make a natural language query, which returns the top 3 modes most similar to their request.

This will be a good addition when there are an overwhelming number of game modes. This will further democratize the app by sending these user queries to the developers to get ideas for new modes (assuming it hasnt been created).

Scenario (1): 
- User remembers playing a mode and describes it using a chatbot-like query.

Scenario (2): 
- User wants to find a mode similar to an idea they have. Developers see their query and create the mode in the near future while they enjoy the similar mode.
