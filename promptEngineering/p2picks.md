### Payout structure
Pooled betting structure
- Winners split the losers pot
- If nobody accepts a bet, nobody wins or loses
- If there are participants, but no chose the winner, nobody wins or loses
- If there are participants, but everyone chose the winner, nobody wins or loses
- If the loser pot doesn't split evenly, the remaining points should distributed randomly

Point system
- A point system is used, not real money
- Even if a user accepts a bet, a selection of 'pass' should not be included in the payout; the user should be disregarded, as if they didn't bet at all.

### Accepting a Bet
The user accepts a bet after a bet proposal is made. Their choice is first initialized to 'pass'; the user may then change their choice before the timer runs out.
